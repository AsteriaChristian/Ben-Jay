<h1 align="center">Ben Jay Enterprise: 2025 Sales Audit</h1>

<p align="center">
  <i>An end-to-end data analytics project uncovering the drivers behind declining retail performance.</i>
</p>

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations for Ben Jay Enterprise



Based on the data audit, I recommend the following three actions:

1. *Dynamic Pricing Strategy:* Adjust prices for "Top-selling items" to be within 5% of competitor rates to regain market share.

2. *Logistics Optimization:* Investigate the Abuja distribution center to reduce the 35% "Critical Delay" rate identified in the dashboard.

3. *Customer Retention Program:* Launch a "Loyalty Discount" for products with high negative feedback to offset price sensitivity.
